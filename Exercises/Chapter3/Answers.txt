Array has a .sum function which could be used to get the sum of all elements in the array. That would be divided by .length to obtain the average

6:
  val a = Array(1,2,-6,4,-5,6,7,-7,9)
  println(a.sorted.reverse.mkString(","))
  val ab = ArrayBuffer(1,2,-6,4,-5,6,7,-7,9)
  println(ab.sorted.reverse.mkString(","))
